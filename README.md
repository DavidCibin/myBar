## About
 
Hi! My name is David Cibin. I'm from Brazil but currently living in Massachusetts. I have joined the Software Engineer Immersive program offered by [General Assembly](https://www.generalassemb.ly) in the end of February 2021. This is my project presented to the end of Unit 1, which consists in learning the languages: Javascript, HTML and CSS.
